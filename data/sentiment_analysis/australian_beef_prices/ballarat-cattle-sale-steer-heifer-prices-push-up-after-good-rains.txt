“I thought the heavier steers were fractionally dearer by five to 10 cents,” Mr Nicholson said.

“The heavier weaner steers were similar to a month ago and the same with the lighter steers with an odd, very good pen dear by around five cents,” he said.

Mr Nicholson said lighter heifers from 220kg to 250kg could have been up to $100 cheaper but the best of the heifers were close to prices seen last month.

“People are still nervous about paying the money they have to pay, but the market has been like this for at least eight months now and they have to have cattle,” Mr Nicholson said.

“Feed in the paddock is definitely a good thing and we’re looking to be going into winter in good shape whereas two weeks ago we were a bit worried,” he said.
