Just over 3000 cattle had the saleyards brimming at Yea today.

There were mixed opinions on the market with some believing prices had crept up, while others thinking prices had softened.

Nutrien Ag Solutions agent Jack Ginnane said overall, prices varied on different types of cattle.

“Little steers were up a bit overall but big steers were down … by around 10 to 20 cents,” Mr Ginnane said.

“We had more calves here so there was a bit of a lack of quality and competition on the heavier steers,” he said.

Several large volume lots on offer drew competition from several directions with often more than two bidders on any given lot.

Commission buyers Campbell Ross and Matt Tinkler from Elders were among the notable volume buyers of the day.

Similarly, Mort and Co Grassdale, Garrison and JBS feedlots were all very active.

Scott Yarnold from Thornton was bidding fiercely to secure one such volume lot of 17 Angus steers at 261kg for $1980 or 758c/kg.


While Mr Yarnold said it was “more than I was wanting to pay”, a fantastic season for his grass fed backgrounding operation had him searching for replacement cattle to grow out.

“I sold 14 in April to the abattoir and got $3300 so these will replace them,” Mr Yarnold said.

“We had 65mm in that first lot (of the rain break) then 38mm the other week and another 4mm two nights ago and it’s stayed warm too,” he said.

In the heifer market, most heavier types returned from 550c/kg to just under 600c/kg while heifers under 300kg made not far about that, averaging from 580c/kg to 600c/kg.

“The bottom end of the heifers probably were a little bit cheaper today than previous markets, but the top end we’re just as strong if not a little bit stronger than previous markets in the last couple of months,” Mr Ginnane said.
