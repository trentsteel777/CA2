EYCI breaks eye-watering 1000c/kg

The Eastern Young Cattle Indicator continues to break records as farmers hold their livestock tight and big producers restock.

On July 22 the EYCI reached the $10 mark for the first time in its history – pushing the figure, which is traditionally counted in cents, into the four digits.

After cracking 1000 cents a kilogram, the EYCI forged ahead on July 23 but the weekend break knocked the enthusiasm off, sending the price to 992¢/kg by July 27.

On July 27, Shepparton Regional Saleyards saw 1300 exporters and 365 trade cattle offered - only a handful of those beef cows.

Vealers made up to 540¢/kg, yearling steers 539¢/kg and yearling heifers 530¢/kg.

Friesian steers made up to 361¢/kg and 600 kg-plus bullocks up to 430¢/kg, showing the inflated prices are only coming for the good restocker beef cattle.

It was only in June that the EYCI was making headlines after it broke the 900¢/kg barrier.

Out west the cattle price continues to be a few months ahead of the EYCI and acts as a blueprint for eastern state buyers wondering if there is any end in sight to the inflated prices.

The West Australian and South Australian-focused Western Young Cattle Indicator broke its $10 mark on April 1.

This boom in the WYCI was immediately followed by a drop down to 804¢/kg on April 7 before a steep climb back to 976¢/kg where the price continues.

The WYCI's highest price to date was set on June 6 when the weekly report came out at 1042¢/kg.

Like always for the WYCI, this price was driven by demand seen at the only two saleyards which now contribute to the WYCI – Muchea and Mount Barker.
