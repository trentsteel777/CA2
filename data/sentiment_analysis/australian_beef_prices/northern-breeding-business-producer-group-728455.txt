Kimberley Group
The NB2 Kimberley group held their first meeting on 28-29 October at a ‘terrible’ location in Broome (see photo below).

The group has grown from the original four stations to a group of five. One station dropped out due to unforeseen circumstances, however we picked up an additional two stations.

We had a successful first meeting which covered off on the herd, business and feedbase pillar foundational training sessions and a get-to-know-you group session.

Since then we’ve been in the process of forming a second Pilbara/Kimberley NB2 group who hope to cover off on their foundational training in late February/early March.

We are planning feedbase activities out in the field for March before the mustering season well and truly kicks off in April.


 
Business and herd flow data capture will start in late February for both groups.
