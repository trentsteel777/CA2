Restocker cattle weights resist seasonal impacts in 2021

 

 
Key points:

Restocker cattle weights in 2021 were less impacted by seasonal conditions than in 2019.
The market appreciation in 2021 for young cattle looks to have played a role in seeing lighter animals being turned off in 2021, allowing producers to capture market opportunities.
In the drought year of 2019, restocker steers were on average 10kg lighter than the 10-year average monthly weight.
Contrary to popular belief, the strength of the 2021 season nationally had less of an impact on restocker steer weights than the drought year of 2019 did.

Comparing the two most vastly different seasons on average at a national level for the cattle herd demonstrates that a drought year has far more impact on turn-off weights than an above-average year. The reason for this is that during 2021, the improving cattle market allowed producers to turn off stock at a lighter weight and return stronger margins due to the appreciating market.




 
The heavier weights seen from September onwards during 2021 can be attributed to an uptick in cattle turned off winter grazing pastures and crops such as oats, as well as the favourable growing conditions of spring. Usually, as shown in the above graph, cattle turned off between the months of May and September are generally lighter due to the southern production system’s winter.

Throughout 2019, the restocker turn off weights were 4% or 10kg lighter than the 10-year average. Meanwhile, in 2021, turn-off weight variations on average were softer by 0.56%, or 1.6kg/head.

2019: key takeaways

In 2019, the average restocker turn-off weight for steers was 261kg/head.
For the first six months of 2019, the average weight variation was 11.1kg or 4% lighter than the 10-year average.
Nearing the end of the drought in December 2019 – where the drought was at its worst and turn-off weights were lighter by the highest margin for the year – steers were lighter by 14.2kg/head or 5.1%.
2021: key takeaways

The average restocker steer turn-off weight in 2021 was 269kg, lighter than the 10-year average of 271kg/head.
Turn-off weights for restocker steers for the spring of 2021 were 2kg/head lighter than the 10-year average, demonstrating the impact wet spring had on weight gain performance.
However, December turn-off weights were softer by 3% or 7kg/head – the highest monthly variation result for the year.
