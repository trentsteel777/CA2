Weekly market wrap

 

 
Key points:

The WA heavy lamb price is currently outperforming its eastern states equivalent by 96c/kg cwt.
Demand for restocker steers in Queensland continues to remain strong.
Goat slaughter volumes are at their highest since October 2020.
WA sheep and lamb market
All lamb indicators in the west are outperforming year-ago levels.
Trade and heavy weight lambs are performing significantly stronger, with continued high demand for these heavier carcases – as well as continued low supply due to seasonal conditions – placing upwards pressure on pricing.
The WA Heavy Lamb Indicator is currently priced 197c or 28% higher than year-ago levels, to sit at 889c/kg cwt.
This is a premium to the Eastern States Heavy Lamb Indicator of 96c/kg cwt or 12%.
Trade lambs are currently operating 117c/kg higher than year ago levels, equivalent to a rise of 16%.
Compared to the Eastern States Trade Lamb Indicator (ESTLI), the premium is narrower than its heavy lamb counterpart – only stronger by 20c or 2.4%.
Tight supply can be attributed to the favourable improvement in prices seen in lambs since the beginning of 2022 in the west.
The mutton market in WA is currently relatively firm to year-ago levels, down by 7c/kg cwt as it continues to fall following a strong January market period.
Queensland restocker demand remains resilient
The Queensland restocker steer price has performed strongly in recent weeks, showing current resilience in the market and demand for steers to grow out and feed following a very strong late spring and summer rainfall period for much of the state.
At present, the price has appreciated 28c or 5.7% in a week to currently sit 14c lower than its record of 778c/kg lwt set on 14 January 2022.
Supply of restocker steers has remained firm since the indicator appreciated 28c.
Demand for steers at CQLX Gracemere is strong, with the saleyard accounting for 29% of the yarding, while its average price is currently at 784c – a 20c/kg lwt or 2.8% premium to the state’s overall price.
Current market conditions show the strong interest for restocker article steers in the Rockhampton region – a positive indicator of demand from producers to rebuild numbers following a string of challenging seasons with low rainfall.
Goat slaughter at highest weekly levels in two years
