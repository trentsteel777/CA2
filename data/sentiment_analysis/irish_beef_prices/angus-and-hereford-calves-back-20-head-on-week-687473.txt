This five-week-old heifer calf weighed 68kg and sold for €140 in Bandon on Monday.
The average price paid in marts for Angus and Hereford calves has reduced by over €20/head on average, according to this week’s ICBF calf price database.

The greatest reduction has been seen for Angus heifers, back €31/head to an average price of €126/head.

Angus bulls averaged €175/head, a reduction of €27/head on the previous seven days.


Hereford calves did not see as big of a reduction, though this could be down to numbers forward for sale.
