The insatiable appetite for slaughter-fit cattle at present is fuelling intense competition in marts and, in turn, is attracting higher numbers of beef cattle to the ring. Athenry Mart in Co Galway recorded a flying trade for any slaughter-fit or cattle within touching distance of hanging up at its weekly sale on Tuesday.

Bullocks weighing from 600kg to 750kg recorded a fine average price of €2.80/kg. The €3/kg milestone was exceeded on three occasions, including the top price per kilo of €3.13/kg paid.



This Angus-cross heifer weighing 545kg and born May 2020 sold for €1,520 (€2.79/kg).

There was only a handful of lots below €2.75/kg, with the lowest price in this weight category recorded at €2.48/kg.

There was in the region of 100 head of bullocks weighing from 500kg to 600kg on offer.
