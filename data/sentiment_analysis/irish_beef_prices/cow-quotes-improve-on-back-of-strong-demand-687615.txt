This February 2014 born Charolais-cross cow weighed 825kg and sold for €2,186 (€2.65/kg) in Elphin this week.
Up to €4.60/kg is on offer this week for heavy U grade cows, on the back of big demand from the manufacturing trade.

Factories are also in full flow killing for the busy Easter trade.

Bullocks are working off €4.65-€4.85/kg and heifers are at €4.70-€4.90/kg. Up to €5.30/kg is being paid for Aberdeen Angus heifers this week.
