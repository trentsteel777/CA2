This April 2019-born Charolais bullock weighed 945kg and sold for €2,580 in Ballinasloe last week. Factory agents continue to drive the mart trade.
Irish beef prices continue to lag behind the EU benchmark price, Bord Bia beef market tracking graphs show.

Last week’s EU benchmark price was at €4.53/kg, while the Irish beef price for all animals stood at €4.41/kg, 12c/kg behind our main market. French young bulls hit €5.20/kg this week.

Foyle Meats in Donegal is top of the factory leagues again this week, with a €4.80/kg base price being paid for bullocks killing between 300kg and 400kg.


Its base price is at €4.85/kg for heifers.

The general run of quotes are €4.60/kg to €4.65/kg base price for bullocks, while heifers are working off €4.70/kg to €4.75/kg. Bulls under 24 months have also increased in price this week with €4.85/kg being paid for U grading bulls in some factories this week.

Good-quality R and U grading cows are now hitting as high as €4.55/kg in factories, with some specialised operators very active for cows this week.

This demand is fuelled by a big appetite for cow beef in the food service trade and a contracting kill of cows across the water, leaving holes in supply chains that Irish processors have been quick to fill.

Across the water, the English beef trade continues to improve.

Quotes have improved by 2p/kg last week to bring average steer prices to €5.17/kg, while average heifer prices have moved to €5.19/kg.


Further afield, the Brazilian price touched the equivalent of €4/kg on Monday of this week.
