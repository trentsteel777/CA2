Finished cattle are holding their value in Northern Ireland, but hoggets and lambs have seen prices easing.
Factory prices for prime cattle are holding firm this week, but there is plenty of life in the cull cow trade.

Farmers with a good supply of cattle to sell remain in a strong position to negotiate for higher prices and there are deals on offer.

The live ring is also extremely buoyant and prices for high quality cattle are running ahead of those paid by factories.


As such, mart managers report that more farmers are offloading animals through the live ring, capitalising on the competition between specialist finishers and agents buying for factories.

Official quotes are unchanged, with most plants working from a base of 414p to 420p/kg.

Most farmers offloading steers report that 430p to 434p/kg is freely available, with higher prices reserved for finishers handling larger numbers.

Heifers remain on deals around 436p/kg, rising to 440p/kg for larger numbers or animals suited to butchery and wholesaler outlets.

As supplies of steers and heifers tighten, young bulls are becoming a more valuable commodity.

Several farmers with in-spec animals report price deals matching those for steers are available, although others are struggling to better a base of 420p/kg.

Last week, the average price paid across steers and heifers of all grades increased by 2.7p to 420.85p/kg.

On U3 grading animals, steers jumped by 4.3p to average 434.7p/kg, while heifers also increased by 2.3p to 476.5p/kg.

Young bulls at the same grade increased by 3.8p/kg to average 418.1p/kg.

Cows

Demand for cull cows is rampant, with prices continuing to edge upwards. Quotes for R3 cows remain on 354p/kg, with O+3 animals on 344p/kg.

However, good-quality cows are making 370p/kg and upwards, with farmers reporting 380p/kg paid for animals possessing higher levels of conformation.

NI sheep: trade under pressure as buying demand cools

With the buying period for Ramadan finishing this week and factories closed for the May bank holiday, the sheep trade has come under pressure.

Factory quotes on spring lambs have slipped to 625p/kg, while hoggets have eased to 575p/kg.

In Kilrea, lambs topped 641p/kg for 19.5kg or £125, with 610p paid for 21kg at £128. Top price per head was £136 for 26kg.

Massereene sold 109 lambs to 609p/kg for 21.5kg at £131, with 598p for 21kg at £125.50. Top price per head was £135.50 for 24kg.

Hoggets topped 522p/kg for 23kg at £120, with 521p/kg paid for 24kg at £125.

In Saintfield, lambs sold from £134 to £137 for 25kg to 28kg, with £132 for 21kg to 23kg. Hoggets made £131 to £136 for 26kg to 30kg.

In Rathfriland, 361 lambs made 545p to 602p/kg and averaged 575p/kg.

Ewes

Fat ewes are holding their value, with Kilrea topping £202. In Massereene, the top was £180 for Rouge, with £178 for Texels and £172 for Suffolks.

In Saintfield, top prices were £237, £228 and £226, with others making from £165 to £210. Rathfriland sold a big show of fat ewes to £235.
