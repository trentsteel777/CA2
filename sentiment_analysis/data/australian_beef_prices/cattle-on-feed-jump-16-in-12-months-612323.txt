MLA has released the latest Lot feeding brief, compiled from results of the ALFA and MLA June quarter 2021 feedlot survey. The brief reveals the current status of the lot feeding industry in Australia.

The ALFA survey highlights cattle on feed remained above one million head in the June 2021 quarter, with capacity remaining firm at 1,448,085 head and utilisation up significantly on the March 2021 quarter.

Feedlots continue to provide production certainty in a disrupted COVID-19 environment. This has been attractive to operators throughout the supply chain, ensuring product to support domestic and global consumption.

Previous March quarter results reflected that 47% of cattle slaughtered were coming out of feedlots. While these statistics will not be available until Friday 20 August, historically high percentages of grainfed slaughter are excepted to continue, as retention of cattle on grass promotes a significant grainfed proportion.
