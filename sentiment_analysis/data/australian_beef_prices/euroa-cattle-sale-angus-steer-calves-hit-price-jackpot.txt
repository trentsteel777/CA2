Injemira bull sale grosses nearly $2m
A record average of $20,565 has set a new benchmark for Hereford cattle after the Injemira bull sale in NSW.
A run of little Angus steer calves hit the price jackpot at Euroa yesterday, selling for liveweight money that put them among the highest seen at saleyards in recent months.

The yarding featured several lines of young spring drop calves, well-bred but lightweight with the majority having curfewed weights of less than 250kg.

Selling between $1800 to $2000 per head they tracked above 750c to a peak of 947c/kg liveweight or $1820 for a pen of 36 head that averaged 192kg, although this weight wasn’t displayed for buyers.

Wayne Ellis, manager of Seven Creeks at Euroa, and the property's young calves at 232kg which made $2000 or 862c.

“It is bloody unbelievable how well they have sold,’’ said commission buyer Peter Tuohey as he watched the action.

“It is obvious people are buying dollars per head and they are not worried about the cents per kilogram.’’

The drying autumn season, and the big money on offer for store calves, was the reason behind the unusually large offering of young and lightweight calves.

Among the drafts was a run of 64 7-month-old Angus steers from local Euroa property Seven Creeks. They had 31 calves at 265kg which made $2050 or 773c, followed by the second cut of 33 at 232kg which made just $50 less at $2000 to work out at 862c.

“All these steer calves were out of first calving heifers and they have sold exceptionally well,’’ said Seven Creeks property manager Wayne Ellis.

“The season is starting to get tight and I think a few people are starting to sell some calves now to save on a bit of hay (and prepare cows for the winter),’’ he said.


Commission buyers and local northeast restockers dominated the sale, with lines of straight-bred black cattle selling markedly better than other breeds and colours.

The heaviest spring drop weaner steers sold to a top of $2360 for the opening pen of 27 Angus bred by Sarah Butler and family of Moranding Park near Kilmore. With a weight of 335kg they also cracked the 700c mark.

In comparison, further down the laneway there was Charolais Angus-cross steers at 348kg which sold for $2140 to work out at 614c to be nearly 100c behind the blacks.

The Weekly Times spoke to one commission buyer who was able to put together a run of 56 Euro and Hereford and Shorthorn steers for an average just below 600c, with the cattle destined for a NSW feedlot.
