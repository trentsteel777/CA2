Giving Expo 2020 red meat flavour

 

 
For 170 years, World Expos have provided a platform to showcase the greatest innovations that have shaped the world today. These include the showcasing of early television and phone technology advancements to food developments such as popcorn and Heinz ketchup. Expo 2020 will continue that tradition with the latest technology from around the globe.

The event facilitates a global gathering of 192 participating nations dedicated to finding solutions to current pressing challenges across three themed topics of mobility, sustainability and opportunity. The six-month event offers a single site to facilitate connecting minds, creating the future through engaging and immersive activities between countries. Despite the false start of EXPO 2020 due to COVID-19, the event kicked off on 1 October 2021 with a significant official opening, similar to that of an opening ceremony at an Olympics.

The whole location of the Expo site covers 438 hectares, has 84 food outlets and over 150 interactive robots roaming the pathways providing assistance and engagement with visitors. Along with this, countries have the opportunity to showcase their own technological advancements to the world.

Meat & Livestock Australia has partnered with the Australian pavilion to fund two corporate chefs to travel to Dubai (one in October and one in March) to showcase True Aussie Beef and Lamb on the menu at the pavilion for the duration of the Expo. They will create unique dishes that are showcased at VIP events, as well as hold cooking demonstrations onstage outside the Australian pavilion. MLA has also secured an event on 19 and 20 January (in the Australian pavilion) to showcase the role Lambassadors play across the globe and how they position lamb as a premium product.
