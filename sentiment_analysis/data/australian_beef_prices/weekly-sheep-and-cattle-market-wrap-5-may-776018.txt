Weekly sheep and cattle market wrap 5 May

 

 
Key points:

The Western Young Cattle Indicator (WYCI) hit a new record after good rainfall in WA.
Restocker lamb prices are easing while light lamb prices bounce back.
The RBA interest rate was increased on Tuesday for the first time since 2010.
WYCI hits a high
The Western Young Cattle Indicator (WYCI) hit a new record this week at 1,222.66¢/kg cwt after strong April rainfall in WA improved restocker sentiments. This beat the previous record from 22 April by 3¢, with the indicator increasing 73¢ on Tuesday after the Muchea sale. However, while prices are stronger, yardings are still seasonally softer.

Medium steers recover
Medium steer prices have bounced back by 60¢ week-on-week following interest from restockers which pushed up demand. CTLX Carcoar offered a 60¢ premium on the national average, contributing just under 12% due to stronger restocker demand which is competing with processor and feeder sales.

Meanwhile, the Eastern Young Cattle Indicator (EYCI) is up 20¢ week-on-week at 1107.75¢ /kg cwt. Roma offered a 39¢ premium on the national average after strong rains in Queensland last week improved restocker sentiment. While Roma had softer yardings at nearly 3,000 head with more buyers present, the quality was better across all the categories.
