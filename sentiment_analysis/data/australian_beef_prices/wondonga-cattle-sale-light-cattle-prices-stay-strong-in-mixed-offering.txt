'Time to make hay': What farmers want from Election 2022
National Farmers' Federation chief executive Tony Mahar discusses the priorities for Australian farmers heading into the 2022 federal election.
Prices may have been judged cheaper at Wodonga’s store cattle market today but there were no complaints from vendors.

The mixed offering included some well-bred lines which sold to the extreme rates seen at other centres, but quality determined whether cattle fell into this price bracket or sold cheaper.

The bulk of the offering of about 1600 cattle was steers, with a few lanes of heifers and some cows and calves.

Heavy steers sold to $2840 (12 Angus, 550kg, 516c/kg) while heifers sold to $2230 with the best price paid for Angus (5 at 378kg, 590c/kg).

Yet again, the lightest cattle generated extreme rates per kilogram, selling up to 908 cents a kilogram for 191-kilogram Angus steer weaners which were just six to seven months, and made $1735.

Steers with weight consistently made 580c/kg and more, while those under 400 kilograms made 600-725c/kg for Angus, and those under 250kg up sold mostly above 700c/kg.

There were several pens that broke the 800c/kg mark including 15 Angus sold by Douglas Paton Family Trust, with the 226-kilogram steers making $1860 (823c/kg); and the second and third drafts of the St Fillian cattle from Narbethong, which made $1850 (224kg, 826c/kg) and $1735 (191kg, 908c/kg).

Partnership, Mudgegonga, with her top pen of steers, seven to eight months, making $2200 (304kg, 724c/kg) while the second lighter pen at 270 kilograms made $2100 (778c/kg). Later in the sale, the heifer portion made up to 669c/kg.


Ms Brewer said the care in breeding decisions and a decision to sell earlier than normal had paid off.

“The prices are incredible and it’s reward for always wanting to make your cattle better,” she said.

Competition for heifers kept price solid, with most making 550c/kg or more.

The best of the unjoined heifers made $2230, paid for the top pen from L Edney, with five weighing 378 kilograms returning 590c/kg.

Some standout results included Bogong View, which sold 11 Angus-Limousin, 373 kilograms, for $2200 (590c/kg) while B and R White matched this making $2200 for their pen of Charolais-Angus, 375 kilograms, which returned 587c/kg.

Isolated pens broke the 600c/kg mark, including the Brewer Fischer Herefords, as well as C and Briggs with their Angus heifers, 295kg, which made $1800 (610c/kg) and Cottonwoods, which sold 13 Charolais-cross heifers, 335kg, for $2010 (600c/kg).
