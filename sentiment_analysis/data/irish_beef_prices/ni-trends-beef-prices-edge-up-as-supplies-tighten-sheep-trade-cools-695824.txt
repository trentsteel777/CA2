NI Trends: beef prices edge up as supplies tighten; sheep trade cools
Prices for cattle have increased at processing plants in Northern Ireland this week, but hoggets and lambs have eased.

Prices for prime cattle and cull cows are still rising in Northern Ireland.
Base quotes continue to rise for prime animals and cull cows as processors compete for supplies of cattle that are showing signs of tightening.

At the upper end of the quotes for prime animals, U-3 grading cattle are up 4p to 424p/kg.

But it is at the lower end of the spectrum where the largest increases have been applied, with most plants now operating on a base of 418p to 422p/kg.


However, despite the upturn in quotes, they are still lagging well below the price deals on offer.

Farmers selling cattle on a regular basis indicate that deals of 440p to 444p/kg are available on steers and heifers this week.

Heifers are an easier sell than steers, with butcher-type animals commanding higher prices. Farmers with smaller numbers report deals being made at 334p to 338p/kg for in-spec animals.

As supplies tighten, young bulls are becoming increasingly more valuable and there is plenty of scope to negotiate on price.

With cattle agents getting eager for stock, there have been reports of 430p to 434p/kg being paid for a steady supply of in-spec animals.

Where bulls are running into very heavy carcase weights, prices are being tied closer to base quotes, unless bigger numbers can be provided.


Last week, the average price paid across steers and heifers of all grades rose by 2.3p to 423.5p/kg.

For U3 grading animals, steers rose by 1.5p to average 436.2p/kg, with heifers increasing by 1.1p to 437.6p/kg. Young bulls at the same grade jumped 6.5p to 424.6p/kg.

Cows

The trade for cull cows is on fire.

Base quotes are up 4p to 358p/kg for R3 animals, with O+3 cows on 348p/kg.

However, quotes are not reflective of the prices being paid. Good-quality beef cows are making north of 370p/kg.

At the top end of the market, there have been reports of 390p to 400p/kg paid for beef cows with high levels of conformation.

NI sheep: processors look to cap prices

Factory quotes for spring lambs have eased slightly, with the best quote of 620p/kg payable to 21kg deadweight. Hoggets are on 575p to 22kg.

Massereene sold 135 lambs to a top of 602p/kg, with 21kg making £126.50, 590p/kg for 20.5kg at £121, 581p/kg for 21.5kg at £125 and 577p/kg for 21.5kg at £124.

The top hoggets made £128 for 33kg, with £127 for 26kg and £125 for 24kg. There was a big run from £120 to £124 for 24.5kg to 29kg.

In Saintfield, lambs were slightly easier from £130 to £135 for 23.5kg to 30kg. Lambs at 22kg made £127, with 20kg selling to £126.

In Rathfriland, 348 lambs sold from 547p to 600p/kg and averaged 577p/kg, up 2p/kg on last week.

Ewes

With Ramadan finished, the trade for fat ewes has eased.

In Kilrea, top price was £183. In Massereene, top was £150, with a big run from £125 to £148.

In Saintfield, top price was £198, with a big run from £128 to £175. In Rathfriland, a big show of 174 fat ewes sold to £224.
